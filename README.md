## Notes
I made this keyboard for a personal project, I am new to the circuit/keyboard designing in game. If you have any suggestions on improving the design in any form or fashion. If you open the pcb design you will see a bunch of numbers to the left of the finished design, those are spacing numbers for the footprints that I used.
